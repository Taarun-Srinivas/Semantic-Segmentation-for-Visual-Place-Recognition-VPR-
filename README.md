# Semantic-Segmentation-for-Visual-Place-Recognition-VPR-

# Idea
The main idea of this work is to generate semantic data for training an autonomous car, detect and have a good understanding of it's environment. In this work, I have generated semantic data for different seasonal modalities. These seasonal modalities are clear night, clear sunset, rain noon, and wet cloudy weather. This algorithm is built on top of [STEGO](https://github.com/mhamilton723/STEGO) algorithm. The objective of this work is to use this semantic data to achieve [Visual Place Recognition (VPR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03281)
